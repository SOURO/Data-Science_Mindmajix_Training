install
-------
sudo apt install mongodb

# When you start mongod you're basically saying "start the MongoDB process and run it in the background". mongod has several default parameters, such as storing data in /data/db and running on port 27017. mongo is the command-line shell that connects to a specific instance of mongod .

starting shell
--------------
To connect with mongo we have to first start 'mongod' services.
sudo mongod

# then in anther terminal
sudo mongo
# and then to stop
> exit

Problems:
#########
# Try the following two things:

# By default, Mongo points to that /data/db folder, and it either forgets to create or set ownership of it on installation.
sudo mkdir -p /data/db/
# And then, we’ll set the ownership of the folder to the user that’s going to start the mongod service. Since I only use if for local development in my computer, I set myself as the owner:
sudo chown `id -u` /data/db
Now, just running mongod should work.


# open config file
sudo vi /etc/mongodb.conf


sudo systemctl status mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongodb
sudo systemctl stop mongodb
sudo systemctl restart mongodb

sudo systemctl enable mongodb
sudo systemctl disable mongodb

# or using the service
sudo service mongodb restart
sudo service mongod restart

uninstall
---------
sudo systemctl stop mongodb
sudo apt purge mongodb (sudo apt-get --purge mongo*)
sudo apt autoremove

# Misc
#######
# to check whether mongod is enabled
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

# If it shows as "disabled", then you need to enable it.
sudo systemctl enable mongod.service

# If we want to see whether mongod.service file exists in case this file is missing, check in
ls /lib/systemd/system

# You will see a file
/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service




systemctl list-unit-files | grep mongod
